There are two types of people in this application , admins and normal users(costumers) at first the admin will need to log in and add the products he wants to add to the "database" enter their price etc so they can be shown to the users .
Then the user can log in and browse the products available , potentially adding them to his cart and proceeding to the payment , he can of course edit his carts' contents beforehand and delete some if necessary .Each user has of course
his own cart totally independant from other users .
A product is linked to his user by his userReference , it's the user token generated when the user registers.
